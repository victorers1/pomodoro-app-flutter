# pomodoro

A new blazingly fast highly scalable Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that follows the
[simple app state management tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple).

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in the `lib/features/localization` directory.

To support additional languages, please visit the tutorial on [Internationalizing Flutter apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)

## Designs
